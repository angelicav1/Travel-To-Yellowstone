        <h2>Why Yellowstone National Park?</h2>
        <h3>Yellowstone, the world's first national park</h3>
        <p>
          On March 1, 1872, Yellowstone became the first national park for all
          to enjoy the unique hydrothermal and geologic features. Within
          Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres, visitors have unparalleled
          opportunities to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore
          geothermal areas that contain about half the world’s active geysers,
          and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone
          River.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellowstone’s location at the convergence of the Great Plains, Great
          Basin, and Columbia Plateau Indian cultures means that many Native
          American tribes have traditional connections to the land and its
          resources. For thousands of years before the park was established,
          this area was a place where Native Americans hunted, fished, gathered
          plants, quarried obsidian, and used the thermal waters for religious
          and medicinal purposes. Yellowstone’s ethnographic resources are the
          natural and cultural features that are significant to tribes. They
          include sites, plant and animal species, objects associated with
          routine or ceremonial activities, and migration routes. Federal law
          requires the National Park Service to consult with Yellowstone’s
          associated tribes on a government-to-government basis on decisions
          which affect resources that are significant to tribes.
