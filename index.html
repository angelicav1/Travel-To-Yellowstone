            <h2>Why Yellowstone National Park?</h2>
            <h3>Yellowstone, the world's first national park</h3>
            <p>
              On March 1, 1872, Yellowstone became the first national park for
              all to enjoy the unique hydrothermal and geologic features. Within
              Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres, visitors have unparalleled
              opportunities to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore
              geothermal areas that contain about half the world’s active
              geysers, and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the
              Yellowstone River.
            </p>
            <p>
              For thousands of years before the park was established, this area
              was a place where Native Americans hunted, fished, gathered
              plants, quarried obsidian, and used the thermal waters for
              religious and medicinal purposes. Federal law requires the
              National Park Service to consult with Yellowstone’s associated
              tribes on a government-to-government basis on decisions which
              affect resources that are significant to tribes.

                <h4>See bears</h4>
                <p>
                  Yellowstone is home to two species of bears: grizzly bears and
                  black bears. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is one of few
                  areas south of Canada where these two bear species coexist.
                </p>
                <h5>Bear Safety:</h5>
                <p>
                  Park regulations require that people stay at least 100 yards
                  (91 meters) from bears.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  All of Yellowstone is bear habitat so you can see bears at any
                  point during your visit; from the deepest backcountry to the
                  boardwalks around Old Faithful.

                <h4>See wolves</h4>
                <p>
                  Yellowstone is wolf country. Since 1973, the Rocky Mountain
                  Wolf was listed as an endangered species with three recovery
                  areas designated in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
                </p>
                <h5>Wolf Safety:</h5>
                <p>
                  Park regulations require that people stay at least 100 yards
                  (91 meters) from wolves.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  The wolves are such elegant creatures to admire. You can see
                  them walking alongside bison. They maintain balance in the
                  Yellowstone ecosystem.

                <p>
                  Yellowstone was set aside as the world’s first national park
                  because of its hydrothermal wonders.
                </p>
                <h5>Hot Spring Safety:</h5>
                <p>
                  Don't touch it! Water can reach temperatures of 400℉ causing
                  severe bodily harm.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  The park contains more than 10,000 thermal features, including
                  the world’s greatest concentration of geysers as well as hot
                  springs, mudpots, and steam vents such as the famous Old
                  Faithful geyser.
